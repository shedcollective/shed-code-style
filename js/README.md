# JavaScript

We use js-hint to lint JS and have adopted the AirBnb Code style (with some additions).


## Installing the linter

The easiest way is to use the tool in the root of this repository:

```
./install.sh
```


## Configuring PHPStorm

1. Open rpeferences
2. Go to `Languages & Frameworks › JavaScript › Code Quality Tools › JSHint`
3. Enable the tool
4. Configure the tool to "Use config files" and use the default location
5. Click OK

## Configuring Sublime

1. Ensure Package Control is installed
2. Ensure `SublimeLinter` package is installed
3. Install `SublimeLinter-jshint` package
