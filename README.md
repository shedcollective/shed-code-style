# Shed's Coding Standards and Linters

This repository explains our coding standards as well as provides instructions for configuring linters for your IDE.

- [PHP](php/README.md)
- [JS](js/README.md)
- [CSS](css/README.md)

If you're looking for a quick fix and want to install all the linters you can use:

```
./setup-linters.sh
```

This will ensure that all the linters are installed correctly and symlink the configuration files to the right place.
