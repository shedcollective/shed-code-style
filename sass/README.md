# CSS

We use sass-lint from Sass Tools to lint PHP. Currently configs must be defined at a project level.


## Installing the linter

The easiest way is to use the tool in the root of this repository:

```
./install.sh
```


##Â Configuring PHPStorm

1. Open preferences
2. Install the `Sass Lint` plugin by `Ido` and restart PHPStorm
3. Enable `Sass Lint` in preferences
4. Set the paths to `node` and `sass-lint`
5. Let `sass-lint` search for the `.sass-lint.yml` file
6. Click OK

## Configuring Sublime

2. Ensure `SublimeLinter` package is installed
